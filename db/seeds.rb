On top of her full-time role, she is regularly posting helpful resources, new roles and apprenticeships on LinkedIn for others seeking opportunities. She is also continuing to grow her skills by taking a Python class at Foothill College. Juliana entered the tech world landing a contract role at Facebook as a content moderator. While the position was anything but easy, it exposed her to her first classes in coding. As her contract neared completion she looked for other opportunities and came across Techtonica, a Software Engineering bootcamp specifically for womxn and non-binary folx. She applied and was accepted to the bootcamp, and six months later she started interning at Remix. Initially one of the reasons Juliana wanted to get into tech was because she wanted to be a part of positive change in the industry. She acknowledges that it’s an ambitious task but cherishes the small wins. Some of the issues she highlights are lack of diversity, especially in tech leadership, and work-life balance. ”Work-life balance seems to be a rare thing in tech, and that may be one of the reasons some people can’t break in, especially mothers.” Proud moments in her career include completing the Techtonica bootcamp, in which she built an app with the help of more experienced engineers, and building and delivering a real project with clients during her internship.
